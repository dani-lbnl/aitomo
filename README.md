    Aim: Enabling using deep learning at facilities to produce real-time visualization and analysis during experiments
Potential outcomes:
A document describing current and future strategies for realizing implementations of real-time visualization and analysis, including tools for annotation which are fundamental for enabling deep learning as even unsupervised methods require annotation to provide evidences that they are optimized to the purpose they are designed for. The expectaction is that these plans will facilitate future collaborations and could lead to several novel methods and scientific publications.
