    Aim: Enabling using deep learning at facilities to produce real-time visualization and analysis during experiments
Potential outcomes:
A document giving an overview of existing infrastructures, software, requirements, and interfaces. This information can be made publicly available as a resource website.
Understanding what is needed to enable real-time deep-learning processing at a facility.
A document describing plans for realizing implementations of real-time visualization and analysis, including a list of interested participants. These plans will facilitate future collaborations and could lead to several novel methods and scientific publications.
